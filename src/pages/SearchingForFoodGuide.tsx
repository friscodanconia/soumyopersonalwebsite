          India is a country that thinks about food constantly. From the first morning chai to the
          last evening snack, food threads through every conversation, every festival, every family
          gathering. And increasingly, it threads through our search bars too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google search data reveals which dishes capture our collective curiosity — and which ones
          we eat every day without a second thought. As you scroll through the following interactive
          graphics, you'll discover how roughly 30 iconic dishes reflect the culture, geography,
          and rhythms of a nation of 1.4 billion people.

            It's not even close. Biryani is the most searched food in India — and has been for as
            long as Google Trends data exists. What's surprising is what comes next: roti, the
            humblest bread, is #2. If India's food identity had a single search ambassador, the
            data says it would be biryani. But the full picture tells a richer story.

            But beneath the biryani juggernaut lies a rich ecosystem of dishes that tell a more
            nuanced story. The bubbles below show the 20 most searched dishes in India, sized by
            their relative search interest over the past five years.

            Here's the plot twist the data reveals: biryani isn't just #1 nationally — it
            dominates search in virtually every single state. From Kashmir to Kerala, Tamil Nadu
            to Tripura, biryani is the most searched dish. The regional food map isn't a patchwork
            of local champions — it's a biryani empire with fascinating runners-up.

            The pandemic changed how India searched for food. Locked indoors, people turned to
            their kitchens — and their search bars — with a new intensity. Some dishes surged
            as comfort food; others fell as street food became inaccessible.

          Food search data is a mirror — not of what India eats, but of what India <em>aspires</em> to eat,
          what it celebrates, what it misses when it's away from home. Behind every search query is a
          person standing in their kitchen, wondering how to make the biryani their grandmother made,
          or trying dosa for the first time, or looking up the perfect ladoo recipe before Diwali.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next time you search for a recipe, remember: you're adding your own data point to a
          story that 1.4 billion people are writing together, one search at a time.

          <p>
            Search data pulled from Google Trends via pytrends (India, 5-year average, accessed
            February 2026). Each dish compared head-to-head with biryani as the anchor term.
            State-level data uses interest_by_region with the same methodology. Consumption
            rankings estimated from NSSO 68th round household expenditure surveys and ICMR-NIN
            dietary guidelines. Pandemic comparison uses 2019 vs 2021 data within a single
            2018–2022 query for consistent normalization.
